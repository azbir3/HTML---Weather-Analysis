## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this homework I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations and dataframe I've created in a past assignment (see Python_API_WeatherHW repo). 

In building this dashboard, I've created a home page which describes the project ,individual pages for each plot, which are accessable via Plots dropdown menu in the navigation bar and by clicking on the respective image in the Visualisaion box. The individual plot pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them. The user can return to the homepage from any page by clicking on the name of the project ("Weather Analysis") in the navigation bar.
